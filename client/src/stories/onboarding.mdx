## Introduction
Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. Thousands of teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. It's open source and free.
For more information, visit [storybook.js.org](https://storybook.js.org/)ã€‚

## Stories
How can we build stories in the project? There are two ways: using MDX or TypeScript. To maintain consistency, we always create xxx.stories.ts or xxx.mdx files under the respective component folder.

## Grammar & Examples

### MDX
``` mdxjs
import { Meta } from "@storybook/blocks";
